This app is a work in progress.

I am creating a web app that will allow users to create and edit notes. This app
is backed by a Mongo database and includes a RESTful API as well as Mocha/Chai
tests.

The Mongo DB and RESTful statements are complete.  I have yet to create an HTML
page. Also, the Chai tests don't yet work as expected (they don't work out of a
separate DB).
